I developed an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The project features a user-friendly interface designed with CSS to provide an engaging and visually appealing experience. 
The game logic was implemented in JavaScript, allowing for dynamic handling of user choices, adherence to game rules, and accurate determination of game outcomes.
The user interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear visual feedback provided for each playerâ€™s move and game results with points.
